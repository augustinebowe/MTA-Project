Dear Augustine,


I’m in dire need of help, and you come highly recommended.  I own several buildings across Manhattan where the upper floors are zoned for residential occupancy, and the ground floors are zoned for commercial use.  Since the pandemic began, many of my commercial tenants have closed, and I need to fill the leases, or I will be forced to sell off the buildings.  


Traditionally, my bread and butter has been leasing the storefronts to lunch restaurants that cater to office workers, but despite dropping the rent, I still can’t get any of them to take a lease in any of my buildings.  I need to know if I should keep going back to the same well, or if I need to broaden my horizons.  


I need you to get me an answer pretty quickly – hopefully in the next couple of weeks
